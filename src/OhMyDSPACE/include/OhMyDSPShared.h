// Interface between the OhMyDSP kernel extension and userspace (the daemon / test tools). Plain C, shared by both sides.
//
// The kext exposes one IOUserClient (root only, one client at a time) with two memory regions and three external methods:
//   memory type 0   the DMA capture ring: raw S32_LE, 2 channels interleaved (mic A, mic B), ringBytes long, read-only for the client
//   memory type 1   struct OhMyDSPStatus (one page), read-only for the client
//   method 0 start  power the DSP up and start the capture stream   (blocks ~150 ms)
//   method 1 stop   stop the stream and power the DSP down
//   method 2 tune   scalar in: [0] = key (OHMYDSP_TUNE_*), [1] = value
// Position: the ring is written by the HDA DMA engine. `lpib` is the byte position of the DMA at the last kernel tick (5 ms), `laps`
// counts completed laps. Frame number F (counted from the start of the run) lives at ring byte (F * frameBytes) % ringBytes, and the time
// at which ring frame 0 of lap `laps` was written is `lapHostTime` (mach_absolute_time units, same clock in kernel and userspace).
// After a recovery restart `laps` is advanced by one so the sample timeline stays monotonic; frames of the gap are simply missing (epoch changed).
